## Course Description
This course introduces basic concepts, algorithms, and techniques of data mining on different types of datasets, including (1) vector data, (2) set data, (3) sequence data, (4) text data, and (5) graph data. The class project involves hands-on practice of mining useful knowledge from large data sets. The course is an undergraduate-level computer science course. Also, the course may attract students from other disciplines who need to understand, develop, and use data mining techniques to analyze large amounts of data.

## Prerequisites
- You are expected to have background knowledge in data structures, algorithms, basic linear algebra, and basic statistics.
-	You will also need to be familiar with at least one programming language, and have programming experiences.

## Learning Objectives
- Know what data mining is and learn the basic algorithms
- Develop skills to apply data mining algorithms to solve real-world applications
- Gain initial experience in conducting research on data mining

## Grading
-	Homework: 35%
-	Midterm exam: 20%
-	Final exam: 15%
-	Course project: 25%
-	Participation: 5%

## Q & A
-	We will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TAs, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza.
-	Tips: Answering other students' questions will increase your participation score.
